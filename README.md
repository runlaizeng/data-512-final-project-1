# Final Project Plan

## Background
Online hotel reservation makes travel easier, But a large number of online hotel information also makes people become unable to follow. Planning a dream vacation or even a weekend escape can be an overwhelming affair. With hundreds, even thousands, of hotels to choose from at every destination, it's difficult to know which will suit our personal preferences. Should we go with an old standby with those pillow mints we like, or risk a new hotel with a trendy pool bar? 

A recommender system obviously can offer personalized suggestions by analyzing each user's preference by historical data from his/her account. However, the performance falls sharply when it encounters sparse data, especially meets a cold start user or the user just doesn't use an account. 

Since everyone would conduct the search action on the online reservation website, can we find a way to provide personalized hotel recommendations to travelers just based on the search action?
